    "\n",
    "* If the relative transformation between both views is only a horizontal displacement (i.e. cameras are alinged to the same basline). Then the the projection of $C_{left}-P$ to the right view view will be on the same row of pixels as in the left image (the epipoles will be in infinity because the baseline will be parallel to the pixels row).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Camera calibration is the process of calculating the true parameters, i.e. intrinsic, extrinsic and lens distortion properties, of the camera. After calibration it is possible to extract 3D information from the 2D images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will calibrate and therefore optimize a subset of the sensor parameters to enhance the depth estimation. Realsense SDK provides `realsense-viewer` and `dynamic calibration tool` for calibration. We will not cover calibration with these tools in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `realsense-viewer` we can calibrate the following:\n",

    "In this exercise, we will have a look over the \n",
    "1. Read the color, infrared1, infrared2 images in the folder Homework/HW-1-data (images with numbers (1262, 1755, 1131, 0000))\n",
    "2. Use OpenCV Stereo Block Matching to find the disparity map, then use the equation for depth to calculate the estimated depth map. You could assume that (focal_length=970 mm, baseline=50 mm) \n",
    "3. Use OpenCV to visualize the reconstructed depth image along with the infrared images using `cv2.imshow`.\n",
    "A sample reconstruction could be seen in the image below.\n",

    "### 2. Object Twin (workload 3 students):\n",
    "In this exercise, we will load a realsense-viewer rosbag recording, then use opencv and pyrender to create a twin of a moving checkerboard.\n",
    "1. Loading color and depth data:\n",
    "     * Use pyrealsense2 to read the bagfile and acquire color, depth, aligned depth to color, color camera intrinsics, depth camera intrinsics. (Show the images in a loop using `cv2.imshow`)\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. Checkerboard detection and tracking: \n",
    "     * The checkerboard has a `6x9` pattern where each square has an edge length of 4 cm.\n",
    "     * Using opencv we want Find its corners (use `cv2.findChessboardCorners`, and `cv2.cornersSubPix`). then use `cv2.drawChessboardCorners` to overlay the detections on the colored image\n",
    "     * From the previous step, you will have 2D/3D correspondences for the corners. Use `cv2.solvePnP` to estimate the object to camera translation and rotation vectors.\n",
    "     * *Extra:* Use opencv drawing utils and perspective projection function to draw a 3D axis, and a cropping mask for the board. Useful functions here could be `cv2.line,cv2.projectPoints,cv2.fillPoly`.\n",
    "3. Modeling the checkerboard in pyrender:\n",
    "    * Using pyrender create a scene with camera and a `Box` mesh corresponding to the checkerboard.\n",
    "    * Notes:\n",
    "      1. You will need to scale the box and shift its center to match the checkerboard 3d coordinate system in opencv\n",
    "      2. To convert from opencv camera to pyrender camera in you system you may need to rotate your objects by 90 degees around the X-axis (depending on your implementation) \n",
    "4. Visualization and Comparasion:\n",
    "    * In the loop, update the mesh pose with the updated pose of the checkerboard\n",
    "    * Compare the rendered depth value to the actual algined_depth values we got from realsense.\n",
    "    * Optional: Report the Root Mean Squared Error RMSE between the rendered depth, and the actual depth within the detected area\n",
